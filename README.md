# Pixibo Widget
Add this two lines of code in your html file and after reload you'll see a Pixibo button on bottom-right corner of the page:
```
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/lazzyms/pixiboWidget/index.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/lazzyms/pixiboWidget/index.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
 ```
 ## What I did?
 Simply created a React App and installed **reactjs-popup**. Wrote some code and css to built a button which opens a modal/dialog. Packaged this into a mono js and css file with **parcel-bundler** and hosted the files using **jsDelivr**. You can checkout the React code under the [react-app](https://github.com/lazzyms/pixiboWidget/tree/react-app) branch.
